# From Original Paper

The listener had to grade the unknown signals on the MUSHRA scale (0..100). 
The numerical scale is equally divided into five segments and semantical annotated ("bad", "poor", "fair", "good", "excellent"). 


The question asked to the listener was: 
"Grade the [Basic Audio Quality](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1534-3-201510-I!!PDF-E.pdf) of the items under test with respect to the reference signal. 
Any perceived differences between the reference and the other signal must be interpreted as an impairment."

# My suggestion for our toy experiment

Each stimuli consists of a reference part (first 9 seconds) and a test part (last 9 seconds).
The listener had to grade the test part on a 0--100 scale.
The numerical scale is equally divided into five segments and semantical annotated ("bad", "poor", "fair", "good", "excellent"). 


The question asked to the listener is: 

> The first half of the audio stimuli is the reference mix, consisting of bass, electric guitar, and acoustic guitar.
> The second half attempts to isolate the sound of one of the instruments, which you need to evaluate.
>
> Grade the Basic Audio Quality of the isolated part of each stimuli with respect to the reference mix. 
> Any perceived differences between the reference and the isolated signal must be interpreted as an impairment.
