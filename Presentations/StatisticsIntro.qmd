Here is some data simulating a simple linear regression:


```{r linear_regression}
N <- 100
sigma <- 2
alpha <- 3.2
beta <- 1.2


X <- rnorm(N)
Y <- alpha + X * beta + rnorm(N, sd = sigma)

plot(Y ~ X)

```

Here is how we could do a hypothesis test, testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta = 0$.


```{r lmtest}

lm(Y~X) |> summary()

```



Calculated based on the $t$ distribution,  `Pr(>|t|)` value for the `X` coefficient is less than $0.05$.
This test assumes...
